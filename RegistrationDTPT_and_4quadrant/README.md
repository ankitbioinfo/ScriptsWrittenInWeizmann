# RegisterationDTPT_and_4quadrant

Steps to registered two bones. 

1) Run the script Bone_registration_using_eigenvector.m
2) If both DT PT ends are there then give both as input 
3) Do it for all the samples 
4) Save all AlignedXYZ.mat file and give back to me 
5) I will run manualRegisteration_final script 
6) Return you image to visualize two registered bone and Alignment_matrix.dat file
7) Now you can run the 3D maps. 
That's all.
