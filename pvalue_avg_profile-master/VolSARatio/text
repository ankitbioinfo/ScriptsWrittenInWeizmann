We used the moving window approach to find the region in the bone where a negative slope occurs in volume to surface area ratio data. We use the linear regression model to fit a linear equation for each moving window of data points (default window length is chosen 5). Those windows whose linear fit has negative slope are merged and refit the linear equation for entire merged windows. The fit is shown with the blue line and fitting parameters (slope and intercept) are mentioned at the top of each subfigure. The fitted regions are again zoomed in the inset of each subfigure and the errorbar of the fit is plotted with vertical blue lines. The R-squared coefficient of determination for DT, PT, and DU fits are 0.8452, 0.6138 and 0.5865 respectively.
