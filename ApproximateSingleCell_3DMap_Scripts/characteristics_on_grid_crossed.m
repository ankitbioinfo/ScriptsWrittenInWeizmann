function [crossed_grid, grid] = characteristics_on_grid_crossed(all_crossed,opt,gp)
%CHARACTERISTICS_ON_GRID_CROSSED Computes aggregated crossed features 
%(between cells and nuclei) on a 3D grid
%   Input: all individual cells crossed features
%   Output: aggregated crossed2 features on 3D grid

% each row of all_crossed is nucleus
% the columns contains the individual nuclei features
% 1 - stack id
% 2-4 - centroid x,y,z coordinates
% 5 - proportion corresponding
% 6 - n/c ratio
% 7 - centroid shift
% 8-10 - PC1 x,y,z orientation - nucleus
% 11-13 - PC1 x,y,z orientation - nucleus
% 14-16 - PC1 x,y,z orientation - nucleus
% 17-19 - PC1,PC2,PC3 latent coefficient - nucleus
% 20-22 - PC1 x,y,z orientation - cells
% 23-25 - PC1 x,y,z orientation - cells
% 26-28 - PC1 x,y,z orientation - cells
% 29-31 - PC1,PC2,PC3 latent coefficient - cells
