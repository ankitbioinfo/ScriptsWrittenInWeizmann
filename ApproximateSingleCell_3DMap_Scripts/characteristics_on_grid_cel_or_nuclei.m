%CHARACTERISTICS_ON_GRID_CELLS Computes aggregated cells features on a 3D
%grid
%   Input: all individual cells or nuclei features
%   Output: aggregated cells or nuclei features on 3D grid

% each row of all_cells_nuclei is nucleus
% the columns contains the individual nuclei features
% 1 - stack id
% 2 - volume
% 3 - surface area
% 4 - sphericity
% 5-7 - centroid x,y,z coordinates
% 8-10 - PC1 x,y,z orientation
% 11-13 - PC2 x,y,z orientation
% 14-16 - PC3 x,y,z orientation
% 17-19 - PC1,PC2,PC3 latent coefficient
% 20 - Delaunay density
